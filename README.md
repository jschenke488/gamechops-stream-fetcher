# GameChops Stream Fetcher

I created this because I wanted a permalink for [GameChops](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVKYPXwdYUQfgA05CkyFSg) Video Game Study Lounge. Uses the [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped) API to find the stream.

## Usage

1. Clone repo
2. Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/)
3. Run `make`
4. Setup a reverse proxy such as [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
